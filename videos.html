            <h2>Watch F# Presentations</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Community for F# has been organizing and recording F# talks since way before it was cool! Our <a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/c4fsharp">Vimeo</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCQPh0mSMaVpRcKUeWPotSA/feed">YouTube</a> channels have videos of presentations covering everything from Agents to Data Science, Domain-Specific Languages or writing a F# compiler to JavaScript. And much, much more! So check it out, and let us know what you like and don't like, and what (or who) you want to see recorded.</p>

        <p>[F# Online](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1SQsRYPRV0Kw3KCowGJXzA) also has a growing list of video content. Please check it out!</p>

        <p>Coming soon: a searchable index of video content!</p>
